# hello-world
Hello, my name is Tony Chun. I currently work for the largest natural gas utility in Southern California as a team lead for a support group for customer operations and applications IT departments.

I am looking to grow a new skill set by learning programming in Python. I have yet to decide which Python fork to take as it is a really versatile language. I figure I can decide later as I am more interested in really delving in to the language at the moment to gain mastery of it.

Looking forward to building my Python portfolio.
